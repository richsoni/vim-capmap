INTRODUCTION                                    *capmap*

This plugin provides several capital letter mappings that increase
productivity.  They aim to avoid clobbering default vim functionality.


CURRENT BUFFER QUIT                           *capmap-current-buffer-rwq*

The following mapping allows you to read, quit with less keystrokes.


*QQ*  |:q!|<cr>


INLINE MOVEMENT                               *capmap-inline*

The following mappings make inline editing less painful.

(Note that the 'omappings' for 'cL' and 'dL' are less efficient
than using just 'C' or 'D', but come for free with 'omap', so they are
included for completeness)


*L*   |g_|  (Note 'g_' is similar to $, but does not include the newline)
*H*   |0|
*vL*  |vg_|
*vH*  |v0|
*cL*  |C|
*cH*  |c0|
*dL*  |D|
*dH*  |d0|


ADJACENT BUFFER CLOSING                      *capmap-adjacent-buffer-closing*

The following mappings allow you to |:q!| adjacent buffers without
leaving the current buffer.  This is especially useful for 'diff' and
'quickfix' windows.

Just like 'capmap-current-buffer-read-quit', 'Q' is a logical
aliases for |:q!|.  Use capital directional movements HJKL to
execute that command on the adjacent buffer to that direction.


*QH*  <C-W>h||:q!|<cr>
*QL*  <C-W>l||:q!|<cr>
*QK*  <C-W>k||:q!|<cr>
*QJ*  <C-W>j||:q!|<cr>
