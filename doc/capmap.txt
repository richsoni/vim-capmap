INTRODUCTION                                    *capmap*

This plugin provides several capital letter mappings that increase
productivity.  They aim to avoid clobbering default vim functionality.


ADJACENT BUFFER CLOSING                      *capmap-adjacent-buffer-closing*

The following mappings allow you to |:q!| adjacent buffers without
leaving the current buffer.  This is especially useful for 'diff' and
'quickfix' windows.

Just like 'capmap-current-buffer-read-quit', 'Q' is a logical
aliases for |:q!|.  Use capital directional movements HJKL to
execute that command on the adjacent buffer to that direction.
