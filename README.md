# capmap.vim

This plugin was taken from my own mappings.  I saw that there was a pattern to many of them, and
I wanted to share the pattern with colleagues.  Rather than boring them with the theory, and having them
manually add the keybindings, I decided to wrap it in this plugin.

It does nothing fancy, it is just a wrapper for a set of similar keybindings.

## Installation

"If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/richsoni/vim-capmap.git
" ~Tim Pope @timpope

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help capmap`.
